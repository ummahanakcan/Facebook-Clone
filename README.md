## Project Overview
- While developing the project, I followed a tutorial on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NljIHlZRTTE&ab_channel=GreatStack). Unlike the tutorial, I used SCSS in this project, which led to encountering some issues as the project progressed. Specifically, the lack of automatic reflection of SCSS changes in JavaScript, while possible in CSS, required me to revise the JavaScript code to enable toggling between dark and light modes in the main project. You can review the detailed solutions by examining the project.

- I used localStorage to store data in a web application and make it accessible when closing and reopening the browser or reloading the page. ou may refer to the following sources for further information.
